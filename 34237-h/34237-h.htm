<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3><i>On the Reading of Poetry</i></h3>


<p>There is no doubt, I fear, that certain people are born without, as
certain other people are born with, a love of poetry. Any natural gift
is a great advantage, of course, be it physical, mental, or spiritual.
The dear old tales which suggest the presence of fairies at the cradle
of the new-born child, dealing out, not very impartially, talents,
charms, graces, are not so far from the real truth. You may have been
given a straight nose, a rosy cheek, a courteous manner, a lively wit, a
generous disposition; but perhaps the Fairy Fine-Ear, who hears the
grass grow, and the leaf-buds throb, had a pressing engagement at
somebody else's cradle-side when you most needed her benefactions. There
is another elf too, a Dame o' Dreams; she is clad all in color-of-rose,
and when she touches your eyelids you see visions forever after;
beautiful haunting things hidden from duller eyes, visions made of stars
and dew and magic. Never any great poet lived but these two fairies were
present at his birth, and it may be that they stole a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span> moment to visit
you. If such was the case you love, need, crave poetry, to understand
yourself, your neighbor, the world, God; and you will find that nothing
else will satisfy you so completely as the years go on. If, on the other
hand, these highly mythical but interesting personages were absent when
the question of your natural endowment was being settled, do not take it
too much to heart, but try to make good the deficiencies.</p>

<p>You must have liked the rhymes and jingles of your nursery-days:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ride a Cock-horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Banbury Cross!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mistress Mary quite contrary<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How does your garden grow?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I am certain you remember what pleasure it gave you to make "contrary"
rhyme with "Mary" instead of pronouncing it in the proper and prosy way.</p>

<p>"But" you answer, "I did indeed like that sort of verse, and am still
fond of it when it dances and prances, or trips and patters and tinkles;
it is what is termed "sublime" poetry that is dull and difficult to
understand; the verb is always a long distance from its subject; the
punctuation comes in the middle of the lines, so that it reads like
prose in spite of one, and it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span> generally sprinkled with allusions to
Calypso, &OElig;dipus, Eurydice, Hesperus, Corydon, Arethusa, and the
Acroceraunian Mountains; or at any rate with people and places which one
has to look up in the atlas and dictionary."</p>

<p>Of course, all poems are not equally simple in sound and sense. It does
not require much intelligence to read or chant Poe's Raven, and if one
does not quite understand it, one is so taken captive by the weird,
haunting music of the lines, the recurrence of phrases and repetition of
words, that one does not think about its meaning:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">''Tis some visitor, I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only this, and nothing more.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The moment, however, that your eye falls upon the following lines from
"Paradise Lost" you confess privately that if you were obliged to parse
and analyze them the task would cause you a weary half-hour with Lindley
Murray or Quackenbos.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Adam the goodliest man of men since born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sons; the fairest of her daughters Eve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under a tuft of shade that on a green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood whispering soft, by a fresh fountain-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sat them down;"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Very well then, do not try to parse them; Paradise Lost was not written
exclusively for the grammarians; content yourself with enjoying the
picture; the frisking of the beasts of the earth, while Adam and Eve
watched them from a fountain-side in Paradise.</p>

<p>No one need be ashamed of liking a good deal of rhyme and rhythm, swing
and movement and melody in poetry; absolute perfection of form, though
all too rarely attained, is one of the chief delights of the
verse-lover. "<i>The procession of beautiful sounds that is a poem,</i>" says
Walter Raleigh. It is quite natural to love the music of verse before
you catch the deeper thought, and you feel, in some of the greatest
poetry, as if only the angels could have put the melodious words
together. There is more in this music than meets the eye or ear; it is
what differentiates prose from poetry, which, to quote Wordsworth, is
the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge. Prose it is said can never
be too truthful or too wise, but song is more than mere Truth and
Wisdom, it is the "rose upon Truth's lips, the light in Wisdom's eyes."
That is why the thought in it finds its way to the very heart of one and
makes one glow and tremble, fills one with desire to do some splendid
action, right some wrong, be something other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span> than one is, more noble,
more true, more patient, more courageous.</p>

<p>We who have selected the poems in this book have had to keep in mind the
various kinds of young people who are to read it. The boys may wish that
there were more story and battle poems, and verses ringing with spirited
and war-like adventures; the girls may think that there are too many
already; while both, perhaps, may miss certain old favorites like
Horatius or The Ancient Mariner, omitted because of their great length.
Some of you will yawn if the book flies open at Milton; some will be
bored whenever they chance upon Pope; others will never read Wordsworth
except on compulsion. Romantic little maids will turn away from "Tacking
Ship off Shore," while their brothers will disdain "The Swan's Nest
Among the Reeds"; but it was necessary to make the book for all sorts
and conditions of readers, and such a volume must contain a taste of the
best things, whether your special palate is ready for them or not. When
you are twenty-one you may say, loftily, "I do not care for Pope and
Dryden, I prefer Spenser and Tennyson, or Ben Jonson and Herrick," or
whatever you really do prefer,&mdash;but now, although, of course, you have
your personal likes and dislikes, you cannot be sure that they are based
on anything real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span> or that they will stand the test of time and
experience.</p>

<p>So you will find between these covers we hope, a little of everything
good, for we have searched the pages of the great English-speaking poets
to find verses that you would either love at first sight, or that you
would grow to care for as you learn what is worthy to be loved. Where we
found one beautiful verse, quite simple and wholly beautiful, we have
given you that, if it held a complete thought or painted a picture
perfect in itself, even although we omitted the very next one, which
perhaps would have puzzled and wearied the younger ones with its
involved construction or difficult phraseology.</p>

<p>Will you think, I wonder, that this very simple talk is too informal to
be quite proper when one remembers that it is to serve as introduction
to the greatest poets that ever lived? Informality is very charming in
its place, no doubt (for so the thought might cross your mind), but one
does not use it with kings and queens; still the least things, you know,
may sometimes explain or interpret the greatest. The brook might say, "I
am nothing in myself, I know, but I am showing you the way to the ocean;
follow on if you wish to see something really vast and magnificent."</p>

<p>There are besides gracious courtesies to be observed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span> on certain
occasions. If a famous poet or author should chance to come to your
village or city and appear before the people, someone would have to
introduce the stranger and commend him to your attention; and if he did
it modestly it would only be an act of kindliness; a wish to serve you
and at the same time bespeak for him a gentle and a friendly hearing.
Once introduced&mdash;Presto, change! If he is a great poet he is a great
wizard; the words he uses, the method and manner in which he uses them,
the cadence of his verse, the thoughts he calls to your mind, the way he
brings the quick color to your cheek and the tear to your eye, all these
savor of magic, nothing else. Who could be less than modest in his
presence? Who could but wish to bring the whole world under his spell?
You will readily be modest, too, when you confront these splendid poems,
even although some of you may not wholly comprehend as yet their
grandeur and their majesty; may not fully understand their claim to
immortality. Where is there a girl who would not make a low curtsey to
Shakespeare's Silvia, Milton's Sabrina, Wordsworth's Lucy, or Mrs.
Browning's Elizabeth? And if there is a boy who could stand with his
head covered before Horatius, Herv&eacute; Riel, Sir Launfal, or Motherwell's
Cavalier he is not one of those we had in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span> mind when we made this book.
Neither is it altogether the personality of hero or heroine that fills
us with reverence; it is the beauty and perfection of the poem itself
that almost brings us to our knees in worship. A little later on you
will have the same feeling of admiration and awe for Shelley's Skylark,
Emerson's Snow Storm, Wordsworth's Daffodils, Keats's Daybreak, and for
many another poem not included in this book, to which you must hope to
grow. For it is a matter of growth after all, and growth, in mind and
spirit, as in body, is largely a matter of will. It is all ours, the
beauty in the world: your task is merely to enter into possession.
Chaucer, Spenser, and Shakespeare are yours as much as another's. The
great treasury of inspiring thoughts that has been heaped together as
the ages went by, that "rich deposit of the centuries," is your
heritage; if you wish to assert your heirship no one can say you nay; if
you will to be a Cr&oelig;sus in the things of the mind and spirit, no one
can ever keep you poor.</p>

<p>We have brought you only English verse, so you must wait for the years
to give you Homer, Virgil, Dante, Goethe, Schiller, Victor Hugo, and
many another; and of English verse we have only given a hint of the
treasures in store for you later on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span></p>

<p>We have quoted you poems from the grand old masters, those "bards
sublime,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whose distant footsteps echo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the corridors of Time,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and many a verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"from some humbler poet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose songs gushed from his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As showers from the clouds of summer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or tears from the eyelids start;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who through long days of labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nights devoid of ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still heard in his soul the music<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wonderful melodies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Since you will not like everything in the book equally well, may we
advise you how to use it? First find something you know and love, and
read it over again. (Penitent, indeed, shall we be if it has been
omitted!) The meeting will be like one with a dear playfellow and friend
in a new and strange house, and the house will seem less strange after
you have met and welcomed the friend.</p>

<p>Then search the pages until you see a verse that speaks to you
instantly, catches your eye, begs you to read it, willy-nilly. There are
dozens of such poems in this collection, as simple as if they had been
written for six-year-olds instead of for the grown-up English-speaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>
world: little masterpieces like Tennyson's Brook, Kingsley's Clear and
Cool, Shakespeare's Fairy Songs, Burns's Mountain Daisy, Emerson's
Rhodora, Motherwell's Blithe Bird, Hogg's Skylark, Wordsworth's Pet
Lamb, Scott's Ballads, and scores of others.</p>

<p>This so far is pure pleasure, but why not, as another step, find
something difficult, something you instinctively draw back from? It will
probably be Milton, Pope, Dryden, Browning, or Shelley. You cannot find
any "story" in it; its rhymes do not run trippingly off the tongue;
there are a few strange and unpronounceable words, the punctuation and
phrasing puzzle you, and worse than all you are obliged to read it two
or three times before you really understand its meaning. Very well, that
is nothing to be ashamed of, and you surely do not want to be vanquished
by a difficulty. You will realize some time or other that all learning,
like all life, is a sort of obstacle race in which the strongest wins.</p>

<p>I once said to a dear old minister who was preaching to a very ignorant
and unlearned congregation, "It must be very difficult, sir, for you to
preach down to them"; for he was a man of rare scholarship and true
wisdom;&mdash;"I try to be very simple a part of the time," he answered, "but
not always; about once a month I fling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span> the fodder so high in the rack
that no man can catch at a single straw without stretching his neck!"</p>

<p>Now pray do not laugh at that illustration; smile if you will, but it
serves the purpose. Just as we develop our muscles by exercising our
bodies, so do we grow strong mentally and spiritually by this
"stretching" process. You are not obliged to love an impersonal, remote,
or complex poem intimately and passionately, but read it faithfully if
you do not wish to be wholly blind and deaf to beauties of sense or
sound that happier people see and hear. Joubert says most truly: "You
will find poetry nowhere unless you bring some with you," but there are
some splendid things in verse as in prose that you stand in too great
awe of to love in any real, childlike way. It is never scenes from
Paradise Lost that run through your mind when you are going to sleep. It
is something with a lilt, like:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Up the airy mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Down the rushy glen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We daren't go a-hunting<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For fear of little men;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or a poem with a gallant action in it like Marco Bozzaris, or with a
charming story like The Singing Leaves, or a mysterious and musical one,
like Kubla Khan or The Bells, or something that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span> when first you read it
made you a little older and a little sadder, in an odd, unaccustomed way
quite unlike that of real grief:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A feeling of sadness and longing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That is not akin to pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And resembles sorrow only<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As the mist resembles rain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When you read that verse of Longfellow's afterwards you see that he has
expressed your mood exactly. That is what it means to be a poet, and
that is what poetry is always doing for us; revealing, translating
thoughts we are capable of feeling, but not expressing.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will not for a long time see the beauty of certain famous
reflective poems like Gray's Elegy, but we must include a few of such
things whether they appeal to you very strongly or not, merely because
it is necessary that you should have an acquaintance, if not a
friendship, with lines that the world by common consent has agreed to
call immortal. They show you, without your being conscious of it, show
you by their lines "all gold and seven times refined,"&mdash;how beautiful
the English language can be when it is used by a master of style. Young
people do not think or talk very much about style, but they come under
its spell unconsciously and respond to its influence quickly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span> enough. To
give a sort of definition: style is a way of saying or writing a thing
so that people are <i>compelled to listen.</i> When you grow sensitive to
beauty of language you become, in some small degree at least, capable of
using it yourself. You could not, for instance, read daily these
"honey-tongued" poets without gathering a little sweetness for your own
unruly member.</p>

<p>There are certain spiritual lessons to be gained from many of these
immortal poems, lessons which the oldest as well as the youngest might
well learn. Turn to Milton's Ode on his Blindness. It is not easy
reading, but you will begin to care for it when experience brings you
the meaning of the line, "They also serve who only stand and wait." It
is one of a class of poems that have been living forces from age to age;
that have quickened aspiration, aroused energy, deepened conviction;
that have infused a nobler ardor and loftier purpose into life wherever
and whenever they were read.</p>

<p>Prefacing each of the divisions of this volume you will find a page or
"interleaf" of comment on, and appreciation of, the poems that follow.
These pages you may read or not as you are minded; they are only
friendly or informal letters from an old traveller to a pilgrim who has
just taken his staff in hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by you will add poem after poem to your list of favorites, and
so, gradually, you will make your own volume of Golden Numbers, which
will be far better than any book we can fashion for you. Perhaps you
will copy single verses and whole poems in it and, later, learn them by
heart. Such treasures of memory "will henceforth no longer be
forgettable, detachable parts of your mind's furniture, but well-springs
of instinct forever."</p>

<h3><i>A Chanted Calendar</i></h3>


<p>Here is the Year's Processional in verse; the story of her hours, her
days, her seasons, told as only poets can, because they see and hear
things not revealed to you and me, and are able by their magic to make
us sharers in the revelation. Read the first six poems and ask yourself
whether you have ever realized the glories of the common day; from the
moment when morning from her orient chambers comes, and the lark at
heaven's gate sings, to the hour when the moon, unveiling her peerless
light, throws her silver mantle o'er the dark, and the firmament glows
with living sapphires.</p>

<p>It is the task of poetry not only to say noble things, but to say them
nobly; having beautiful fancies, to clothe them in beautiful phrases,
and if you search these poems you will find some of the most wonderful
word-pictures in the English language. How charming Drayton's
description of the summer breeze:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The wind had no more strength than this,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That leisurely it blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make one leaf the next to kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i4">That closely by it grew."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If the day is dreary you need only read Lowell's "June Weather," and
like the bird sitting at his door in the sun, atilt like a blossom among
the leaves, your "illumined being" will overrun with the "deluge of
summer it receives."</p>

<p>Then turn the page; the picture fades as you read Trowbridge's
"Midwinter." The speckled sky is dim; the light flakes falter and fall
slow; the chickadee sings cheerily; lo, the magic touch again and the
house mates sit, as Emerson saw them,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Around the radiant fireplace enclosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a tumultuous privacy of storm."<br /></span>

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>The World Beautiful</i></h3>


<p>"Study Nature, not books," said that inspired teacher, Louis Agassiz.</p>

<p>The poets do not bring you the fruit of conscious study, perhaps, for
they do not analyze or dissect Dame Nature's methods; with them genius
begets a higher instinct, and it is by a sort of divination that they
interpret for us the power and grandeur, romance and witchery, beauty
and mystery of "God's great out-of-doors." The born poet, like the born
naturalist, seems to have additional senses. Emerson says of his friend
Thoreau that he saw as with microscope and heard as with ear-trumpet,
while his memory was a photographic register of all he saw and heard;
and Thoreau the naturalist might have said the same of Emerson the poet.</p>

<p>Glance at the succession of beautiful images in Shelley's "Cloud" or
Aldrich's "Before the Rain", lend your ear to the tinkle of Tennyson's
"Brook." Contrast them with the bracing lines of the "Northeast Wind,"
the rough metre of "Highland Cattle," the chill calm of "Snow Bound,"
the grand style of Milton's "Morning," the noble simplicity of Addison's
"Hymn," and note how the great poet bends his language to the mood of
Nature, grim or sunny, stormy or kind, strong or tender. There is a
stanza in Pope's "Essay on Criticism" which conveys the idea perfectly:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The line too labors, and the words move slow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main."<br /></span>

<h3><i>The Brook in Winter</i></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down swept the chill wind from the mountain peak,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From the snow five thousand summers old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On open wold and hill-top bleak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It had gathered all the cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whirled it like sleet on the wanderer's cheek;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It carried a shiver everywhere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the unleafed boughs and pastures bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little brook heard it and built a roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath which he could house him, winter-proof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night by the white stars' frosty gleams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He groined his arches and matched his beams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slender and clear were his crystal spars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the lashes of light that trim the stars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sculptured every summer delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his halls and chambers out of sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes his tinkling waters slipt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down through a frost-leaved forest crypt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, sparkling aisles of steel-stemmed trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bending to counterfeit a breeze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes the roof no fretwork knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But silvery mosses that downward grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes it was carved in sharp relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quaint arabesques of ice-fern leaf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes it was simply smooth and clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the gladness of heaven to shine through, and here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had caught the nodding bulrush-tops<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung them thickly with diamond drops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crystalled the beams of moon and sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a star of every one:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No mortal builder's most rare device<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could match this winter-palace of ice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas as if every image that mirrored lay<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In his depths serene through the summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each flitting shadow of earth and sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest the happy model should be lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been mimicked in fairy masonry<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the elfin builders of the frost.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But turn your eye, and they are there again.<br /></span>

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>On the Wing</i></h3>


<p>Our "little brothers of the air," have you named them all without a gun,
as Emerson asks in "Forbearance"? Shy, glancing eyes peer from nests
half-hidden in leaves; the forest is vocal with melody, the air is
tremulous with the whirr of tiny wings.</p>

<p>Poet-singers have written undying lines about their brother minstrels of
the wood, and the "blithe lark," especially, has a proud place in
poetry, apostrophized as he is by Shakespeare, Shelley, Frederick
Tennyson, Wordsworth, and The Ettrick Shepherd.</p>

<p>As the skylark's note dies away we hear the saucy chatter of Cranch's
Bobolink, the twitter of Keats's Goldfinches, the mournful cry of Celia
Thaxter's Sandpiper, and the revolving wheel of Emily Dickinson's
Humming-bird, with its resonance of emerald, its rush of cochineal. The
feathered warblers, Robin, Bluebird, Swallow, speed their southern
flight, but there are other songs of summer, voices of sweet and tiny
cousins, heard at the lazy noontide; chirpings, rustlings of the green
little vaulters in the sunny grass. And if the wee grasshoppers and
those warm little housekeepers the crickets, have served as themes for
Keats and Leigh Hunt, so has the humble bee provoked his tribute from
the poets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His feet are shod with gauze,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His helmet is of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His breast a single onyx<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With chrysophrase inlaid."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Come within earshot of his drowsy hum, his breezy bass,&mdash;Father Tabb's
publican bee,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Collecting the tax<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On honey and wax,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>or Emerson's yellow-breeched philosopher,</p>

<h3><i>Sir Lark and King Sun: A Parable</i></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Good morrow, my lord!" in the sky alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang the lark as the sun ascended his throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Shine on me, my lord; I only am come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all your servants, to welcome you home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have flown right up, a whole hour, I swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To catch the first shine of your golden hair."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Must I thank you then," said the king, "Sir Lark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For flying so high and hating the dark?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You ask a full cup for half a thirst:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half was love of me, and half love to be first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's many a bird makes no such haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But waits till I come: that's as much to my taste."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And King Sun hid his head in a turban of cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sir Lark stopped singing, quite vexed and cowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he flew up higher, and thought, "Anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wrath of the king will be over and gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his crown, shining out of its cloudy fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will change my brown feathers to a glory of gold."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Came through the depths of the misty air;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His wings had had no chrism of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his feathers felt withered and worn and old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He faltered, and sank, and dropped like a stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there on his nest, where he left her, alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat his little wife on her little eggs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeping them warm with wings and legs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Did I say alone? Ah, no such thing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in her face was shining the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Welcome, Sir Lark! You look tired," said he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Up</i> is not always the best way to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While you have been singing so high and away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've been shining to your little wife all day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He had set his crown all about the nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of the midst shone her little brown breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so glorious was she in russet gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for wonder and awe Sir Lark grew cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He popped his head under her wing, and lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As still as a stone, till King Sun was away.<br /></span>

<h3><i>The Inglenook</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With his flute of reeds a stranger<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wanders piping through the village,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beckons to the fairest maiden,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she follows where he leads her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving all things for the stranger."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The ancient arrowmaker is left standing lonely at the door of his
wigwam, but Laughing Water and Hiawatha have gone to make a new
household among the myriad homes of earth.</p>

<p>It matters not whether the inglenook be in wigwam or cabin, cottage or
palace, if <i>Love Dwells Within</i> be graven upon the threshold, for "where
a true wife comes, there home is always around her." She is the Domina
or House Lady, and under the benediction of her gaze arise sweet order,
peace, and restful charm. The "gudeman," too; "his very foot has music
in't when he comes up the stair," and like the fire on the hearth he
diffuses warmth and comfort and good cheer. By and by a cradle swings to
and fro in the sheltered corner of the fireside; baby feet have come to
stray on life's untrodden brink; baby eyes whose speech make dumb the
wise smile up into the mother's as she sings her lullaby:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Queen has sceptre, crown, and ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">You are my sceptre, crown, and all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it's O! sweet, sweet, and a lullaby."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The dog and the cat snooze peacefully on the hearth, the kettle hums,
the kitchen clock ticks drowsily. The circle of love widens to take in
all who are helping to make home beautiful&mdash;the farm boy, the milkmaid,
and even the whinnying mare and friendly cow.</p>

<p>The poetry of the inglenook is simple, unpretentious, humble, but it has
a tender charm of its own because it sings of a heaven far on this side
of the stars:</p>

Nations, like individuals, have their "play-spells," and Shakespeare,
Drayton, and "rare Ben Jonson" belong to that wonderful age of Elizabeth
when more than ten score of poets were making England a veritable nest
of singing-birds.</p>

<p>Dowden says of the exquisite songs scattered through Shakespeare's
plays, that if they do not make their own way, like the notes in the
wildwood, no words will open the dull ear to take them in. Of Drayton we
give you here "The Arming of Pigwiggen," from "Nymphidia," and later on
"The Battle of Agincourt," called, respectively, the best fantastic poem
and the best war poem in the language.</p>

<p>Then comes Milton the sublime; Milton set apart among poets; so that the
adjective Miltonic has come to be a synonym for gravity, loftiness, and
majesty. After Milton, Dryden, often called the greatest poet of a
little age; but if he lacked the true sublimity he reverenced in the
great Puritan, he was still the first, and perhaps the greatest, master
of satirical poetry. Then, more than half a century afterward, comes
Coleridge with his dreamy grace and his touch of the supernatural; his
marvellous poetic gift, of sudden blossoming and sad and premature
decay. Contemporary with Coleridge was Shelley, the master singer of his
time, pouring out, like his own skylark, "his full heart in profuse
strains of unpremeditated art."</p>

<p>When these two voices were hushed the Victorian era was dawning and the
laurel worn by Wordsworth was placed on the brow of a poet who, by his
perfect grace of manner, melody of rhythm, finished skill, clear
insight, and nobility of thought, gave his name to the Tennysonian age.</p>

<span class="i0">The goblin marked his monarch well;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He spake not, but he bowed him low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then plucked a crimson colen-bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And turned him round in act to go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way is long, he cannot fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His soil&eacute;d wing has lost its power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he winds adown the mountain high,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For many a sore and weary hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through dreary beds of tangled fern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through groves of nightshade dark and dern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the grass and through the brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where toils the ant and sleeps the snake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now over the violet's azure flush<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>

<span class="i2">And now he thrids the bramble-bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till its points are dyed in fairy blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has leaped the bog, he has pierced the brier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has swum the brook, and waded the mire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till his spirits sank, and his limbs grew weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red waxed fainter in his cheek.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had fallen to the ground outright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For rugged and dim was his onward track,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there came a spotted toad in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he laughed as he jumped upon her back:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bridled her mouth with a silkweed twist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lashed her sides with an osier thong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, through evening's dewy mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With leap and spring they bound along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the mountain's magic verge is past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beach of sand is reached at last.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Only this, and nothing more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eagerly I wished the morrow;&mdash;vainly I had sought to borrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From my books surcease of sorrow&mdash;sorrow for the lost Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Nameless here for evermore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thrilled me&mdash;filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">This it is, and nothing more."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I scarce was sure I heard you"&mdash;here I opened wide the door;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Darkness there, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Merely this, and nothing more.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;&mdash;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though its answer little meaning&mdash;little relevancy bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">With such name as "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing further then he uttered&mdash;not a feather then he fluttered&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I scarcely more than muttered "Other friends have flown before&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Then the bird said "Nevermore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>Sports and Pastimes</i></h3>


<p>In ancient tapestries, centuries old, you sometimes see, wrought in
delicate needlework that is faded with the lapse of years, pictures of
the sports of the period. There will be quaint scenes showing otter and
bear hunting, swans' nesting, hawking, chasing the deer, and the like;
in-door scenes, too, depicting pretty pages strumming musical
instruments, and lovely ladies at their tambour or 'broidery frames.</p>

<p>The poetry of each passing age preserves pictures of its plays and
diversions still more perfectly than worn and tattered tapestry, and the
verses we have chosen cover a bewildering variety of pastimes and
recreations. The poets have sounded the praises of almost every kind of
sport: angling, swimming, skating, bubble-blowing, going a-Maying,
walking, riding, whittling, nutting, the country pleasures of "the
barefoot boy," the joys of reading, the delights of music, and the
exhilarations of cruising and travelling. One poem of the immediate
present, Beeching's "Bicycling Song," shows us that the sport of the
moment need not of necessity be too commonplace to be wrought into
verse. At first thought the amusements of these latter days are so swift
and breathless, so complicated with steam, electricity, and other great
forces of the new era, that they seem less poetic than the picturesque
frolics of milkmaids and shepherds, the games of the old Greeks or the
gay sports of the days of chivalry. But after all, as Lowell said,
"there is as much poetry in the iron horses that eat fire as in those of
Diomed that fed on men. If you cut an apple across, you may trace in it
the lines of the blossom that the bee hummed around in May; and so the
soul of poetry survives in things prosaic."</p>

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>A Garden of Girls</i></h3>


<p>Enter a procession of charming girls; wee ones like Nikolina and Jessie,
others, like Peggy, just entering their teens. Some are so saintly we
can almost see the halos above their lovely heads&mdash;like Mrs. Browning's
human angel in the first poem, or like Shakespeare's Silvia, who excels
each mortal thing; others are just happy children, like Little Bell.</p>

<p>The poets, as you will see, have delighted to paint the beauties of this
rosebud garden. There is sweet Phyllis, the little dairymaid, whose hand
seemed milk, in milk it was so white; Annie Laurie, with her brow like
the snowdrift and her voice like wind in summer sighing; merry Margaret,
like midsummer flower; but you will note that in all of them sunny hair
and dewy eyes are not where the beauty lies. "Love deep and kind" leaves
good gifts behind, with Bell and with Mally, too, who is rare and fair
and every way complete, and who is also modest and discreet. On the
other hand, Burns does not describe Nannie by so much as a single word,
but it is easy to conjure up her picture, so eloquently he paints the
dreariness of the world "when Nannie's awa'."</p>

<p>Will you not add to this garden of girls others whom you would like to
see blooming beside them? Remember, it is a rosebud garden, and the
new-comers must be not only beautiful, but sweet and fragrant with
pretty, womanly virtues.</p>

<h3><i>For Home and Country</i></h3>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Such is the patriot's boast, where'er we roam?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His first, best country ever is at home."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the proud claim of Goldsmith's "Traveller," and the same
passionate loyalty to the soil inspires all these poems of Fatherland.
The Scotsman's heart is in the Highlands, the birthplace of valor, the
country of worth; the English warrior boasts of his country:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"And o'er one-sixth of all the earth, and over all the main,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Like some good Fairy, Freedom marks and blesses her domain;"</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the Irish Minstrel-boy tears the chords of his faithful harp asunder
lest they sound in the service of the foe, while the quick, alarming
Yankee drum in Bret Harte's "Reveille" calls upon each freeman to defend
the land of the pilgrim's pride, land where his fathers died.</p>

<p>Religion, war, and glory were the three souls of a perfect Christian
knight, says Lamartine, and if Death's couriers, Fame and Honor, summon
us to the field,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Our business is like men to fight</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And hero-like to die."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In Kipling's "Recessional" and Lowell's "Fatherland" we hear a note as
valiant, but more spiritual. The one makes us remember that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"The tumult and the shouting dies&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>The captains and the kings depart&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>An humble and a contrite heart."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The other leads us to still higher levels of thought, reminding us that
wherever a single soul doth pine, or one man may help another, that spot
of earth is thine and mine&mdash;that is the world-wide fatherland.</p>

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>New World and Old Glory</i></h3>


<p>The verse in this division gives a poetic picture of America, dear land
of all our love, from the very beginning of her world-life. It sings her
story from the time when Columbus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Before him not the ghost of shores,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Before him only shoreless seas,"</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>sailed toward the mysterious continent that lay hidden in the West;
sings it from the thrilling moment when the weary sailors sighted the
new land, up to the twentieth century, when Old Glory waves</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Wherever the sails of peace are seen</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And wherever the war-wind blows."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Heroic figures, familiar to us from childhood, appear in these metrical
versions of episodes in our national history. Here is the red man whose
hour, alas! was struck when first the pale-face looked upon his happy
hunting-grounds; here are Pocahontas and her Captain; the Pilgrim
Fathers; Washington, the soldier-statesman; the embattled farmers who
fired at Concord the shot heard round the world; the Continentals in
their ragged regimentals, and Old Ironsides with its memories of 1812.
Then, when "westward the Star of Empire takes its way," come the
Argonauts of '49, crossing the plains in their white-sailed prairie
schooners in search, like Jason, of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p>The years move on, and Abraham Lincoln, the Great Commoner, dear
benefactor of the race, appears, and, kneeling at his feet, the dusky
slave whose bonds he loosened. Gallant Phil Sheridan and Barbara
Frietchie are here too; indeed, you will find that the number of poems
inspired by the Civil War is very great; but the patriot host, above,
below, knows now no North nor South; and Lincoln's "dear majestic ghost"
looks down upon, as Old Glory floats over, a united commonwealth.</p>

<h3><i>In Merry Mood</i></h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Then cast away care, let sorrow cease,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i8"><i>A fig for melancholy."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>All rules are suspended, grave affairs of state are laid aside, and the
Court Jester demands a hearing. Is it my fancy, or do young eyes
brighten, rosy cheeks dimple, lips part a little when he approaches?
Clad all in gay motley, swinging his bauble, his cap and bells making
merry music, he bounds upon the stage and bids us listen to his quips
and jokes. He is by turns Puck and Ariel, Harlequin, Punchinello, and
Court Fool. "Touchstone" we well may call him, this man of mirth, for
when he tests the world's metal the pure gold of laughter shines out
from the alloy. Seeing us smile even before he opens his lips he assumes
a solemn attitude and cries:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Good people all, of every sort,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Give ear unto my song;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And if you find it wondrous short</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>It will not hold you long."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then hark how the "light-heeled numbers laughing go!" He tells us tales
that smooth out the wrinkles of dull Care and provoke Laughter to hold
both his sides, as well as others less jolly but full of wit and good
cheer. A quaint, breezy moral, too, creeps in here and there, for the
Court Fool, if you study him well, is sometimes a preacher; but whether
frolicking or preaching or philosophizing, he brings with him, like
Milton's nymph:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Jest and youthful jollity,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quips and cranks, and wanton Wiles,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nods and Becks and Wreath&eacute;d Smiles,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And love to live in dimple sleek."</i><br /></span>

<h3><i>Story Poems: Romance and Reality</i></h3>


<p>When the King in Lowell's poem asked his three daughters what fairings
he should bring them on his home-coming, the two elder ones demanded
jewels and rings, silks that would stand alone, and golden combs for the
hair. But the youngest Princess, she that was whiter than
thistledown&mdash;somehow it is always the youngest princess who is beloved
of the poets and romancers&mdash;asked as her fairing the Singing Leaves. The
King could not buy them in Vanity Fair, but in the deep heart of the
greenwood he found Walter, the little foot-page, who drew a thin packet
from his bosom and said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Now give you this to the Princess Anne,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The Singing Leaves are therein."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She took them when the King met her at the castle gate, the lovely
little Princess with the golden crown shining dim in the blithesome gold
of her hair; took them with a smile that</p>

<span class="i0"><i>"Lighted her tears as the summer sun</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Transfigures the summer rain."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poems we give you here, young princes and princesses of the
twentieth century, are all Singing Leaves of one sort or another. There
are leaves that sing tragedies, like those in "Earl Haldan's Daughter,"
"The High Tide," or "The Sands o' Dee"; there are leaves that sing
fantasies, like "The Forsaken Merman," "The Pied Piper," or the
enchanting "Lady of Shalott," weaving her magic web of colors gay. There
are Singing Leaves that grew on the Tree of Reality; leaves that tell
stories like Bret Harte's "Greyport Legend" or Browning's "Herv&eacute; Riel";
while in "Seven Times Two," the "Swan's Nest," "Lord Ullin," "Young
Lochinvar," and "Jock o' Hazledean" you have pure romances, sweet and
youthful, gay and daring.</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then up and spake the eldest daughter,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A music of seas far away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Only the pattering aspen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Made a sound of growing rain,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, where shall I find a little foot-page<br /></span>

<span class="i2">If they grow under the moon?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then lightly turned him Walter the page,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By the stirrup as he ran:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The King's head dropt upon his breast<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lips where smiles went out and in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was no guessing his kith and kin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nobody could enough admire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall man and his quaint attire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth one: "It's as if my great-grandsire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A scarf of red and yellow stripe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To match his coat of the self-same cheque;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In his quiet pipe the while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, like a musical adept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocking tails, and pricking whiskers,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Families by tens and dozens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From street to street he piped, advancing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Until they came to the River Weser,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein all plunged and perished!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Save one, who, stout as Julius C&aelig;sar,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To Rat-land home his commentary:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in after years, if you would blame<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"It's dull in our town since my playmates left!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here's the English can and will!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leapt on board;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass?" laughed they:<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Rocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No such man of mark, and meet<br /></span>

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>When Banners Are Waving</i></h3>


<p>Here are poems of Valor, Fortitude, Fearlessness, Courage. Give yourself
up to the martial swing of the verse, with its clang of armor, its
champing of war-steed, its sound of pibroch, its blare of trumpet, fife,
and drum, its dancing of plumes and glitter of helmets. Pray Heaven that
the fighting be all in a good cause and that the tramp, tramp of
soldierly feet be that of the armies of Right, for there is no resisting
this spirit of daring and bearing when it is voiced so nobly.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"When cannon are roaring,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>And hot bullets flying,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>He that would honor win</i><br /></span>
<span class="i4"><i>Must not fear dying."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here are hymns in praise of famous battles that have changed the fate of
nations; here, records of gallant deeds that make the blood leap in the
veins. Into the Valley of Death rode the immortal Six Hundred, and into
that same Valley plunged "furious Frank and fiery Hun," Scot, Turk,
Greek, and the brave Huguenot charging at Ivry for the Golden Lilies of
France. Here are the songs of triumph, the loud hurrahs when the red
field is won; here tales of glorious defeats and no less splendid
failures; here, too, the dirge for the storied Brave, who lie at rest by
all their Country's wishes blest.</p>

<p>The banners that once beckoned on the arm&eacute;d hosts are hanging to-day in
dim cathedrals, tattered, faded, and torn; high-hung banners that with
every "opened door seem the old wave of battle to remember." And as for
the heroes who carried them, can we not say, as of Marco Bozzaris,</p>

<span class="i0">I sing of the thrice famous deeds she wrought in ancient days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When that great fleet invincible against her bore, in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest hearts in Spain.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
<span class="i0">It was about the lovely close of a warm summer's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail to Plymouth Bay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crew had seen Castile's black fleet, beyond Aurigny's isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving many a mile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At sunrise she escaped their van, by God's especial grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tall Pinta, till the noon, had held her close in chase.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed along the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe's lofty hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along the coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland many a post.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old sheriff comes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind him march the halberdiers; before him sound the drums:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yeoman round the market cross make clear an ample space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there behooves him to set up the standard of Her Grace:<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily dance the bells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As slow upon the laboring wind the royal blazon swells.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Look how the Lion of the sea lifts up his ancient crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay lilies down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stalked he when he turned to flight, on that famed Picard field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bohemia's plume, and Genoa's bow, and C&aelig;sar's eagle shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he turned to bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crushed and torn beneath his claws the princely hunters lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! strike the flagstaff deep, Sir Knight: ho! scatter flowers, fair maids:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ho! gunners, fire a loud salute: ho! gallants, draw your blades:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou sun, shine on her joyously; ye breezes, waft her wide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our glorious <i>Semper Eadem</i>, the banner of our pride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The freshening breeze of eve unfurled that banner's massy fold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The parting gleam of sunshine kissed that haughty scroll of gold;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Night sank upon the dusky beach, and on the purple sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such night in England ne'er had been, nor e'er again shall be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Eddystone to Berwick bounds, from Lynn to Milford Bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That time of slumber was as bright and busy as the day;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For swift to east and swift to west the ghastly war-flame spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on St. Michael's Mount it shone: it shone on Beachy Head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far o'er the deep the Spaniard saw, along each southern shire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cape beyond cape, in endless range those twinkling points of fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fisher left his skiff to rock on Tamar's glittering waves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rugged miners poured to war from Mendip's sunless caves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Longleat's towers, o'er Cranbourne's oaks, the fiery herald flew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roused the shepherds of Stonehenge, the rangers of Beaulieu.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Right sharp and quick the bells all night rang out from Bristol town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the day three hundred horse had met on Clifton Down;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The sentinel on Whitehall gate looked forth into the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw o'erhanging Richmond Hill, that streak of blood-red light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bugle's note and cannon's roar the death-like silence broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one start, and with one cry, the royal city woke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once on all her stately gates arose the answering fires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the wild alarum clashed from all her reeling spires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all the batteries of the Tower pealed loud the voice of fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the thousand masts of Thames sent back a louder cheer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the furthest wards was heard the rush of hurrying feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broad streams of pikes and flags rushed down each roaring street;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broader still became the blaze, and louder still the din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fast from every village round the horse came spurring in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eastward straight from wild Blackheath the warlike errand went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roused in many an ancient hall the gallant squires of Kent:<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Southward from Surrey's pleasant hills flew those bright couriers forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on bleak Hampstead's swarthy moor they started for the north;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on, and on, without a pause, untired they bounded still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night from tower to tower they sprang; they sprang from hill to hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the proud Peak unfurled the flag o'er Darwin's rocky dales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till like volcanoes flared to heaven the stormy hills of Wales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till twelve fair counties saw the blaze on Malvern's lonely height;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till streamed in crimson on the wind the Wrekin's crest of light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till broad and fierce the star came forth, on Ely's stately fane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tower and hamlet rose in arms o'er all the boundless plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Belvoir's lordly terraces the sign to Lincoln sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Lincoln sped the message on o'er the wide vale of Trent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Skiddaw saw the fire that burned on Gaunt's embattled pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red glare on Skiddaw roused the burghers of Carlisle.<br /></span>

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>Tales of the Olden Time</i></h3>


<p>These ancient ballads have come down to us from the long ago, having
been told, like the old nursery tales, from generation to generation,
altered, abbreviated, patched, and added to, as they passed from mouth
to mouth of poet, high harper, gleeman, wandering minstrel,
ballad-monger, and camp-follower. Some of them were repeated by the
humble stroller who paid for a corner in the chimney-nook by the
practice of his rude art; others were sung by minstrels of the court;
most of them were chanted to a tune which served for a score of similar
songs, while the verses were frequently interrupted by refrains of one
sort or another, as, for instance, in "Hynde Horn," which is sometimes
printed as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Near the King's Court was a young child born<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With a hey lillalu and a how lo lan;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his name it was called Young Hynde Horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And the birk and the broom blooms bonnie."</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many of the ballads are gloomy and tragic stories, but told simply and
with right feeling; others are gay tales of true love ending happily.
Some, like "Sir Patrick Spens" and "Chevy Chace," are built upon
historical foundations, and others, while not following history, have a
real personage for hero or heroine. Lord Beichan, for instance, is
supposed to be Gilbert Becket, father of the famous Saint Thomas of
Canterbury, while Glenlogie is Sir George, one of the "gay Gordons," but
whoever they are, wise abbots, jolly friars, or noble outlaws, they are
always bold fellows, true lovers, and merry men.</p>

<p>Inconsequent, fascinating, high-handed, impossible, picturesque, these
old ballads have come to us from the childhood of the world, and still
speak to the child-heart in us all.</p>

<span class="i0">There spread a cloud of dust along a plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And underneath the cloud, or in it, raged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A furious battle, and men yelled, and swords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shocked upon swords and shields. A prince's banner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wavered, then staggered backward, hemmed by foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A craven hung along the battle's edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought, "Had I a sword of keener steel&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That blue blade that the king's son bears,&mdash;but this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blunt thing!" he snapt and flung it from his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lowering crept away and left the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the king's son, wounded, sore bestead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weaponless, and saw the broken sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hilt-buried in the dry and trodden sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ran and snatched it, and with battle-shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifted afresh he hewed his enemy down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saved a great cause that heroic day.<br /></span>

<h2>INTERLEAVES</h2>

<h3><i>The Glad Evangel</i></h3>


<p>When the Child of Nazareth was born, the sun, according to the Bosnian
legend, "leaped in the heavens, and the stars around it danced. A peace
came over mountain and forest. Even the rotten stump stood straight and
healthy on the green hill-side. The grass was beflowered with open
blossoms, incense sweet as myrrh pervaded upland and forest, birds sang
on the mountain top, and all gave thanks to the great God."</p>

<p>It is naught but an old folk-tale, but it has truth hidden at its heart,
for a strange, subtle force, a spirit of genial good-will, a new-born
kindness, seem to animate child and man alike when the world pays its
tribute to the "heaven-sent youngling," as the poet Drummond calls the
infant Christ.</p>

<p>When the Three Wise Men rode from the East into the West on that "first,
best Christmas night," they bore on their saddle-bows three caskets
filled with gold and frankincense and myrrh, to be laid at the feet of
the manger-cradled babe of Bethlehem. Beginning with this old, old
journey, the spirit of giving crept into the world's heart. As the Magi
came bearing gifts, so do we also; gifts that relieve want, gifts that
are sweet and fragrant with friendship, gifts that breathe love, gifts
that mean service, gifts inspired still by the star that shone over the
City of David nearly two thousand years ago.</p>

<p>Then hang the green coronet of the Christmas-tree with glittering
baubles and jewels of flame; heap offerings on its emerald branches;
bring the Yule log to the firing; deck the house with holly and
mistletoe,</p>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three caskets they bore on their saddle-bows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Three caskets of gold with golden keys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their robes were of crimson silk, with rows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bells and pomegranates and furbelows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their turbans like blossoming almond-trees.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so the Three Kings rode into the West,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through the dusk of night over hills and dells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes they nodded with beard on breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sometimes talked, as they paused to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the people they met at the wayside wells.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of the child that is born," said Baltasar,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the people answered, "You ask in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We know of no king but Herod the Great!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thought the Wise Men were men insane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they spurred their horses across the plain<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And cradled there in the scented hay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the air made sweet by the breath of kine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little child in the manger lay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His mother, Mary of Nazareth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Remembering what the angel had said<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the Kings rode out of the city gate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But they went not back to Herod the Great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they knew his malice and feared his hate,<br /></span>
